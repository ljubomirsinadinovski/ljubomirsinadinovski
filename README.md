### About me

I am a software engineer based in Switzerland, but I did my IT degree in the UK. I want to focus on the business value and end-to-end slices while programming. I think Requirement Engineering is crucial for every IT project. My mindset is not typical for a developer and I am always looking forward to forge new connections. My coding skills are still in development I could judge myself as a mid level developer.
